#Operators
# Operators are little symbols that let you do math stuff
#ex
# * is multiply
# / is divide
# + is addition
# you get the idea
# ** is to the power of


# Functions.
# We create functions to make our lives easier
# they look like this : function_name()
# so print() is an example of a function
# we create functions like this:
# def function_name(x):
# 	statement1
#	statement2 (can be any number)
#	return statement

# margaux task! Create a function called square_a_number that takes a variable x (probably numerical)
# squares it, and returns the squared number
